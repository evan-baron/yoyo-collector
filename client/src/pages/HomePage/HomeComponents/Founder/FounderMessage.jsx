					Or at least I hate what social media has become... I believe people
					spend far too much time on their thoughts, editing everything to be
					perfect and "just right" so that their audience or followers won't
					know the better.
					<br />
					<br />
					That's why I've created this monstrosity... a complete rebellion from
					modern day best practices. Say goodbye to your ability to edit,
					update, and delete. If you chose to sign up to this god forsaken
					platform, I hope you hate using it just as much as I do.
